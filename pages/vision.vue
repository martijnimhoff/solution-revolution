                <h2>The Vision</h2>
                <br />
                <p>
                  The COVID-19 crisis provides an unprecedented window of
                  opportunity to present alternative models of economic and
                  social governance to our society.
                </p>

                  A global pause button has been pushed. Driven out of their
                  comfort zone, people are forced to act in unhabitual ways,
                  exploring new angles of perspective.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is up to all of us to determine what happens next - in six
                  months from now, do we want the current economic system to
                  resume its course? Or can we introduce a smarter, more
                  sustainable and fairer alternative? A more logical way
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the things that makes global change difficult for us
                  humans is the daily reality of our economy - in our personal
                  lives and a global level. But guess what, that has now
                  temporarily been put out of order!
                </p>
                <p>
                  By using the power of the internet, we bring together creative
                  and logical thinkers, young and old, that form the jigsaw
                  pieces of this puzzle. If inspired people exchange their
                  ideas, logical solutions will appear.
